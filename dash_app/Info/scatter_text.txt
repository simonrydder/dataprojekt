Below are scatterplots of the compared performence of segments (Organ At Risk) given the chosen comparison. These are constructed in the way that the identity line is plotted together with
points that have x and y values corresponding to the chosen comparisons. The idea is that one easily can see where the points are distributed relative to the identity line 
and given this distribution, the performance of the comparisons can be evaluated. 

* The pros of these plots are that the performance between comparisons can better be evaluated than boxplots and it is possible to see the performance 
between each individual data point.
* The cons of these plots are that it doesn't provide as much information about the specific segments as a boxplot would provide e.g.

*Note*: Remember it is possible to zoom, pan, reset axes and save the image as a PNG by hovering in the upper right side of the plot.
