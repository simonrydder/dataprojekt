The SÃ¸rensen-Dice coefficient (DICE) is a metric used to estimate or determine the level of
similarity between two sets of data. Simply put, the volumtetric DICE is calculated as two times the volume overlap
divided by the total volume of pixels in both images:

$$
DSC=\frac{2(A \cap B)}{A+B}
$$

This metric has become arguably the most broadly used tool in the validation 
of image segmentation algorithms created with AI,
but it is a much more general concept which can be applied to sets of data for a variety of applications 

So if one have an image segmentation of lets say the brain created by an
Deep Learning algorithm and a "ground truth" segmentation drawn by a doctor,
we can calculate the DICE coefficient to measure the level of similarity. The higher the coefficient, the more similarity.
Anything above 0.8 is broadly seen as close to perfect and above 0.9 perfect.

The limitation of DICE is that it is dependent of the volume. So a larger organ as the brain can have many more miss-placed voxels than 
a smaller organ as the brainstem. So a DICE on 0.8 for the brain and brainstem does not equal the same time spent editing by the doctor.
