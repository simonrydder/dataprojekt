The mean surface distance (MSD) calculates the average of the minimum
distances from every point in surface A to every point in surface B, and vice
versa, and returns the average of the two average distances.
This tell us how much, on average, the surface varies between the segmentation
and the "ground truth". Can be mathematically calculated as:

$$
\frac{1}{2}(h(A, B)+h(B, A))
$$
where
$$
h(A, B)=\frac{1}{A} \sum_{a \in A} \min _{b \in B}\|a-b\|
$$

The MSD have the same limitations as the Hausdorff distance even though it tries to take outliers into account. But a large outlier will still have a large influence on the result.
