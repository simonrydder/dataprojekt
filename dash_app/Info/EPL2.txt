In the clinic when drawing the delineation the doctor edits one slice after another, starting from the head towards the toes (corresponding to the z-axis), 
so instead of looking at the segmentation as one 3D image, it gives more sence to look at it as many 2D images.
The EPL is then mathematically defined as the sum of the manually corrected segmentation delineation *A*  for a given slice *z* minus the 
intercept between 'A' and the autosegmentation delineation *B* for a given slice *z*, for all slices *Z*.

$$
\sum_{z \in Z} A_{z} - (A_{z} \cap B_{z})
$$

The illustration below shows how *A* and *B* is defined for a given slice *z*.
