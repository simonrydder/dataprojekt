The Hausdorff distance is the "maximum distance of a set to the nearest point
in the other set". More formally, Hausdorff distance from set A to set B is a maximin function, defined as:

$$
h(A, B)=\max _{a \in A}\left\{\min _{b \in B}\{d(a, b)\}\right\}
$$

where d is the Euclidean distance.

Hausdorff distance measures how far two subsets of a metric space are
from each other. Informally, it is the greatest of all distances from a point
in one set to the closest point in the other set.
The Hausdorff Distance is commonly used in computer vision and in medical image segmentation,
where it is used to compare ground truth images with segmentations allowing their ranking.

The limitation for the Hausdorff distance is that two different segmentations can have the same Hausdorff distance, 
but one segmentation have that distance from all points where another segmentation only have that distance from a few points and are perfect for the rest.
These two cases would have very different editing times for the doctor. At the same time does the Hausdorff distance not take the size of the organ into account.
