Welcome to our Dashboard. Here you can find the results of our data science project on "Performance Testing of Deep Learning 
Autosegmentation Algorithms". 

The dashboard is divided into 3 subpages, "Overview", "EPL Visualization", and "Performance Overview" which can be accessed through the sidebar on the left in the dashboard.


* The sidepage "Overview" includes a short introduction to the project, and a chapter with a thorough explanation of the metrics used, their properties both mathematically and visually.
* Next the page "EPL Visualization" contains a tool that visually explains how the metric 'Edited Path Length' works and yields a greater understanding of the metric. 
* Lastly, the page "Performance Overview" sums up our results in the project in forms of barplots, boxplots and etc. 

As an extra information, you are welcome to visit our GitHub repository to take a deep dive in our code and our implementation.
