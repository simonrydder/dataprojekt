The Edited path length volume ratio (EPL_Volume) is a novel metric introduced 
by Rydder, Kolby & Andersen and is the ratio between the added volume of 
the edited path length and the Final segmenation volume. 

Again this is a ratio meaning it is forced between 0 and 1, which makes it somewhat easy 
to interpret the outcome of. In this case a score of 0 means that no volume was manually added to the 
final segmentation e i. the autosegmentation was equal the final segmenation. Meanwhile a score of 1 indicates
that all volume was added manually meaning no overlap beetween the autosegmentation and the final segmenation.

Again since the doctor is editing several 2D images it can mathematically be described as the sum of 
the added area for each slice on the z-axis, divide by the sum of the area for the final segmenation 
for each slice on the z-axis.

$$
\frac{\sum_{z \in Z} \text{Area}\big(A_{z} - (A_{z} \cap B_{z})\big)}{\sum_{z \in Z} \text{Area}(A_{z})}
$$


This metric is especially great at estimating the change
in the dosis planning of radiation  treatment, since you account for the amount of volume that is added, which is better
than looking at the EPL for this purpose. Since adding a lot of line does not always lead to adding a lot of volume. 
However for this implementation there is still some limitations since it does not really take into account if 
any area is removed from the autosegmentation, hence if the final segmenation is a 
true subset of the autosegmentation it would recieve a score of 0, 
indicating a perfect segmentation, which would not be true. Furthermore it is not an appropiate metric to correlate with the time
spend editing an autosegmentation.
