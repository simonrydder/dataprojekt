The Edited Path Length (EPL) is a novel metric introduced by Vaassen et al.
and is conceptually the distance that an editor's (e.g doctor) cursor travels
when making corrections to an automated segmentation (e.g created with Deep Learning). Numerically it
is the number of voxels in the corrected segmentation surface that are not
shared in the automated segmentation surface.

Vaassen et al. demonstrated that the EPL correlates better with the time
required to correct a segmentation than more traditional and popular metrics such
as the volumetric Dice similarity coefficient or the Hausdorff distance. And therefore do 
the EPL capture the expected time-savings benefit of automated segmentation
better than traditional metrics.

As illustrated in the figure below, adding (or removing) one voxel can have different effects depending of the location.
Therefore it was decided to change the definition of EPL introduced in Vaassen et al. from number of voxels added or removed
to the line \[mm\] added or removed.
