This page is created to give a visual presentation of the 'Edited Path 
Length' implementation. After selecting a 'Patient' (anonymized ID), a segment 
(Organ at Risk), method and tolerance the figure will show two plots. On the
**left** side the 'Ground Truth'-points (black dots), the 'Edited Path Length' 
(darkcyan dotted line) and the 'Guess' of the selected model (orange dotted 
line) from the selected slice. On the **right** side a bar plot of all the 
different metrics, showing the preformance of the selected slice. 

By using the slider or (+/-)-buttoms it is possible to change the slice of the 
segment plottet.
