The Edited path length (EPL) is a novel metric introduced by Vaassen et al.
and is conceptually the distance that an editor's (e.g doctor) cursor travels
when making corrections to an automated segmentation (e.g created with Deep Learning). Numerically it
is the number of pixels in the corrected segmentation surface that are not
shared in the automated segmentation surface.

Vaassen et al. demonstrated that the EPL correlates better with the time
required to correct a segmentation than do traditional, popular metrics such
as the volumetric Dice similarity coefficient or the Hausdorff distance. As such. 
the EPL captures the expected time-savings benefit of automated segmentation
better than traditional metrics. 

Mathematically EPL be calculated as the manually corrected segmentation surface A
minus the intercept between A and the autosegmentation surface B:

$$
A-(A \cap B)
$$

Intuitivily, this corresponds to the line that the doctor needs to correct.
