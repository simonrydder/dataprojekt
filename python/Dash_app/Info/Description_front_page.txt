Welcome to our Dashboard. Here you can find the results of our Performance Testing of different Deep Learning 
autosegmentation algorithms. Moreover, a sidepage with an Edited Path Length visualization tool is implemented
to further conceptually understand the metric and how we implemented it. Lastly, a sidepage with metric overview 
is avalaible to get a quick overview of the different metrics used in our project with their mathematical formulas. 

Finally, you are welcome to visit our GitHub repository to take a deep dive in our code and our implementation.
