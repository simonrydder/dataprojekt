The Hausdorff distance is the "maximum distance of a set to the nearest point
in the other set". More formally, Hausdorff distance from set A to set B is a maximin function, defined as:

$$
h(A, B)=\max _{a \in A}\left\{\min _{b \in B}\{d(a, b)\}\right\}
$$

where d is the Euclidean distance.

Hausdorff distance measures how far two subsets of a metric space are
from each other. Informally, it is the greatest of all distances from a point
in one set to the closest point in the other set.
The Hausdorff Distance is commonly used in computer vision and in medical image segmentation,
where it is used to compare ground truth images with segmentations allowing their ranking.
