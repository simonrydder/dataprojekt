The Sorensenâ€“Dice coefficient (DICE) is a statistic used
estimate or determine the level of the
similarity between two sets of data. 

Simply put, the volumtetric DICE is calculated as two times the volume overlap
divided by the total volume of pixels in both images:

$$
DSC=\frac{2(A \cap B)}{A+B}
$$

This metric has become arguably the most broadly used tool in the validation 
of image segmentation algorithms created with AI,
but it is a much more general concept which can be applied to sets of data for a variety of applications 

So if one have an image segmentation of lets say the brain created by an
Deep Learning algorithm and a "ground truth" segmentation drawn by a doctor,
we can calculate the DICE coefficient to measure the level of similarity. The higher the coefficient, the more similarity.
Anything above 0.8 is broadly seen as close to perfect and above 0.9 perfect.
